**`Data Adventurer(Scientist/Analyst/Artist)`**

### I am a passionate data lover who is enthusiastic about solving real world problems with the data science pipeline one step at a time. Every day I seek to come closer to bridging the gap between people's problems and real data driven solutions. This requires lots of fascinating software tools, useful mathematical methods, and artistically crafted visualizations. Along the way, I love learning new groundbreaking techniques that I hope will enable us to help build a better tomorrow.

  <summary><h3>ðŸ“ŠLogan's Adventure so far....</h3></summary>
  My journey began while working on a term project for my college business management class. The challenge was to manage a small business within a market filled with my fellow classmatesâ€™ identical firms and maximize my profit while limiting my losses. Over time I realized that many of the other firms could be simulated in a way that allowed me to model otherwise unknown decisions of others. This late-night realization propelled me into creating my first ever data driven project, a pricing management support system using excel. As predicted, my new tool functioned as a forecast for coming price and expense strategies of my peers which gave me a leg up on my competition. As time progressed, I discovered that using powerful tools such as Python, SQL and R would allow me to create more accurate and efficient decisions. It was in these pivotal moments that my life had forever taken a turn. On a complete chance, I changed the course of my academic studies to help me learn and understand these amazing tools. As the years progressed, I found myself beginning to conquer much more complex problems such as, predicting cancer fatality risk to help aid physicians, determining the optimal remaining useful life of computer hardware to keep data lakes operational and forecasting stock prices to help minimize investor losses. Currently, I am neck deep in these complex problems and am continuing to broaden my technical horizons so that I find insights and develop tools that can help others through their time on this amazing ride we call life
